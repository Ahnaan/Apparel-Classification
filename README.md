# Apparel Classification

<h2>Abstract</h2><br>

To see the application of keyword extraction and classify the given apparel classes successfully using Computer Vision techniques and applications. This project will help us see how search engine can work using predictive modelling to display the correct results to the user.


<h2>Introduction</h2><br>

Taking the example of Google Images, when you search for anything, it returns a number of correct results depending on your search and those images shown are displayed using numerous concepts. One such concept can be called “keyword extraction”. The term “keyword extraction” refers to the resulting output (in this case the images) to be matching to the given keyword input. Using this input, Google Images gives us the resulting output. Similarly, this concept can especially be seen in an app called Pinterest. Pinterest is an image-based social media network where users and businesses can promote and explore their interests by pinning images and videos on virtual boards that usually have a common theme. Pinterest differs from many other social media platforms in that it is image-based, allowing a following to develop among those with interests that have a strong visual component. Pinterest encourages its users to credit the sources for their images and provide a link back to them. Categorization is key. Pinterest is primarily used for commerce, most pins on the platform represent an idea, product, or service that a consumer wants to try or buy.
So, the idea of classification and keyword extraction is widely used in image related websites and companies. 
Using a dataset from Kaggle, we will try to correctly predict the classes using Computer Vision techniques and applications.
